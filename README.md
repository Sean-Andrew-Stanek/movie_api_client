Movie API Client is a **Single-Page Application (SPA)** utilizing **React** along with **Bootstrap** which will give a GUI representation of the data in an API that was created earlier and which is accessed through a business layer which was similarly created previously.  

With the completion of this achievement as part of CareerForges' **Full Stack** Immersion Course, I displayed the ability to utilize utilize **Node.js** to create a **MERN** stack from back-to-front.

The **MongoDB** and **Express** utilization through the sister-code can be found at:
